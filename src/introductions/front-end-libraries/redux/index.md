## Introduction to the Redux Challenges

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. While you can use Redux with any view library, it's introduced here before being combined with React.
In addition, Redux is an open-source JavaScript management library for web applications. It is most commonly used with libraries like React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to Flux Architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark
